# ---- IMDb Ratings Across Time ----
In this project, I seek to evaluate how IMDb average ratings change over time for each major genre (_e.g.,_ comedy, drama, action).
I used publicly available IMDb data to construct this dashboard.

In the legend, click a genre once to de-select it (and make its data disappear from graph). Double click a genre to de-select all others (and make its data the only one presented in the graph).
